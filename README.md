Digital Twin Replication

This repository extends Repository X and Repository Y, where we aim to replicate a pickup file into a digital twin.
Overview

Our process involves the following steps:

    Generating the Pickup File: Utilize the pickup file obtained from the video stream from Repository X.
    Analyzing the Pickup File: Analyze the generated pickup file to extract meaningful data.
    Predicting Traffic: Perform traffic predictions based on the analyzed pickup file data.
    Replicating in a Digital Twin: Apply the predictions to a networked digital twin to generate another pickup file, ensuring it collaborates with the original pickup file.

Process Flow

    Generate the Pickup File:
        Use the video stream data from Repository X.
        Extract and generate the initial pickup file.

    Analyze the Pickup File:
        Process the pickup file to understand its content.
        Extract relevant information for traffic analysis.

    Predict Traffic:
        Use predictive models to forecast traffic based on the pickup file.
        Generate predictions to be applied in the digital twin environment.

    Replicate in a Digital Twin:
        Implement the predictions into a networked digital twin.
        Generate a new pickup file that collaborates with the original one.

Repository Structure
