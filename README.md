# Network_Digital_Twins part II
This repository extends Repository [Video_server](https://github.com/johnsengendo/Video_server) and [Web_server](https://github.com/johnsengendo/Web_server), where we aim to replicate a pcap file into a digital twin.

The process involves the following steps:
- Generating the Pcap file.
- Analyzing the Pcap file to extract meaningful data.
- Predicting Traffic: Performing traffic predictions based on the analyzed pcap file data.
- Replicating in a Digital Twin: Applying the predictions to a networked digital twin to generate another pcap file, in coloration with the original pcap file.

Repository Structure

- data/: Contains pickup files and related data.
- analysis/: Scripts and notebooks for analyzing pcap files.
- predictions/: Predictive models and scripts for traffic prediction.
- digital_twin/: Implementation of the digital twin replication.
