Digital Twin Replication

This repository extends Repository X and Repository Y, where we aim to replicate a pcap file into a digital twin.

The process involves the following steps:
- Generating the Pcap file.
- Analyzing the Pcap file to extract meaningful data.
- Predicting Traffic: Performing traffic predictions based on the analyzed pcap file data.
- Replicating in a Digital Twin: Applying the predictions to a networked digital twin to generate another pcap file, in coloration with the original pcap file.

Process Flow

    Generate the Pickup File:
        Use the video stream data from Repository X.
        Extract and generate the initial pickup file.

    Analyze the Pickup File:
        Process the pickup file to understand its content.
        Extract relevant information for traffic analysis.

    Predict Traffic:
        Use predictive models to forecast traffic based on the pickup file.
        Generate predictions to be applied in the digital twin environment.

    Replicate in a Digital Twin:
        Implement the predictions into a networked digital twin.
        Generate a new pickup file that collaborates with the original one.

Repository Structure

    data/: Contains pickup files and related data.
    analysis/: Scripts and notebooks for analyzing pickup files.
    predictions/: Predictive models and scripts for traffic prediction.
    digital_twin/: Implementation of the digital twin replication.
