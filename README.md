Digital Twin Replication

This repository extends Repository X and Repository Y, where we aim to replicate a pcap file into a digital twin.

The process involves the following steps:
- Generating the Pcap file.
- Analyzing the Pcap file to extract meaningful data.
- Predicting Traffic: Performing traffic predictions based on the analyzed pcap file data.
- Replicating in a Digital Twin: Applying the predictions to a networked digital twin to generate another pcap file, in coloration with the original pcap file.

Repository Structure

data/: Contains pickup files and related data.
analysis/: Scripts and notebooks for analyzing pcap files.
predictions/: Predictive models and scripts for traffic prediction.
digital_twin/: Implementation of the digital twin replication.
